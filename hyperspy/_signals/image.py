        For multidimensional datasets an optional figure,
        the "navigator", with a cursor to navigate that data is
        raised. In any case it is possible to navigate the data using
        the sliders. Currently only signals with signal_dimension equal to
        0, 1 and 2 can be plotted.

        Parameters
        ----------
        navigator : {"auto", None, "slider", "spectrum", Signal}
            If "auto", if navigation_dimension > 0, a navigator is
            provided to explore the data.
            If navigation_dimension is 1 and the signal is an image
            the navigator is a spectrum obtained by integrating
            over the signal axes (the image).
            If navigation_dimension is 1 and the signal is a spectrum
            the navigator is an image obtained by stacking horizontally
            all the spectra in the dataset.
            If navigation_dimension is > 1, the navigator is an image
            obtained by integrating the data over the signal axes.
            Additionaly, if navigation_dimension > 2 a window
            with one slider per axis is raised to navigate the data.
            For example,
            if the dataset consists of 3 navigation axes X, Y, Z and one
            signal axis, E, the default navigator will be an image
            obtained by integrating the data over E at the current Z
            index and a window with sliders for the X, Y and Z axes
            will be raised. Notice that changing the Z-axis index
            changes the navigator in this case.
            If "slider" and the navigation dimension > 0 a window
            with one slider per axis is raised to navigate the data.
            If "spectrum" and navigation_dimension > 0 the navigator
            is always a spectrum obtained by integrating the data
            over all other axes.
            If None, no navigator will be provided.
            Alternatively a Signal instance can be provided. The signal
            dimension must be 1 (for a spectrum navigator) or 2 (for a
            image navigator) and navigation_shape must be 0 (for a static
            navigator) or navigation_shape + signal_shape must be equal
            to the navigator_shape of the current object (for a dynamic
            navigator).
            If the signal dtype is RGB or RGBA this parameters has no
            effect and is always "slider".
        axes_manager : {None, axes_manager}
            If None `axes_manager` is used.
        colorbar : bool, optional
             If true, a colorbar is plotted for non-RGB images.
        scalebar : bool, optional
            If True and the units and scale of the x and y axes are the same a
            scale bar is plotted.
        scalebar_color : str, optional
            A valid MPL color string; will be used as the scalebar color.
        axes_ticks : {None, bool}, optional
            If True, plot the axes ticks. If None axes_ticks are only
            plotted when the scale bar is not plotted. If False the axes ticks
            are never plotted.
        auto_contrast : bool, optional
            If True, the contrast is stretched for each image using the
            `saturated_pixels` value. Default True.
        saturated_pixels: scalar
            The percentage of pixels that are left out of the bounds.  For example,
            the low and high bounds of a value of 1 are the 0.5% and 99.5%
            percentiles. It must be in the [0, 100] range.
        vmin, vmax : scalar, optional
            `vmin` and `vmax` are used to normalize luminance data. If at least one of them is given
            `auto_contrast` is set to False and any missing values are calculated automatically.
        no_nans : bool, optional
            If True, set nans to zero for plotting.
        **kwargs, optional
            Additional key word arguments passed to matplotlib.imshow()
