"""

Components that can be used to define a model for e.g. curve fitting.

There are some components that are only useful for one particular kind of signal
and therefore their name are preceded by the signal name: eg. eels_cl_edge.

Writing a new template is really easy, just edit _template.py and maybe take a
look to the other components.

For more details see each component docstring.
