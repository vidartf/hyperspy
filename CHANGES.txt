What's new
**********

We only cover here the main highlights, for a detailed list of all the changes
see `the github commits changelog
<https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/commits/master>`_.

v0.8.3
======

This is a maintenance release that includes fixes for multiple bugs, some
enhancements, new features, API changes and adds support for
Python 3. The next major release (HyperSpy 0.9) will not support Python 2.

Importantly, the way to start HyperSpy changes (again) in this release. Please
read carefully :ref:`importing_hyperspy-label` for details.

The broadcasting rules have also changed. See :ref:`signal.operations`
for details.

v0.8.2
======

This is a maintenance release that fixes an issue with the Python installers. Those who have successfully installed v0.8.1 do not need to upgrade.

.. _changes_0.8.1:

v0.8.1
======

This is a maintenance release. Follow the following links for details on all
the `bugs fixed
<https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A0.8.1+label%3Abug&utf8=%E2%9C%93>`_,

<https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A0.8.1++label%3Aenhancement+>`_
and `documentation
<https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A0.8.1+label%3Adocumentation>`_ enhancements.

Importantly, the way to start HyperSpy changes in this release. Read :ref:`importing_hyperspy-label` for details.

It also includes some new features and introduces important API changes that
will be fully enforced in HyperSpy 0.9.

New features
------------
* Support for IPython 3.0.
* ``%hyperspy`` :ref:`IPython magic <magic-label>` to easily and transparently import HyperSpy, matplotlib and numpy when using IPython.
* :py:class:`~._components.expression.Expression` model component to easily create analytical function components. More details
  :ref:`here <expression_component-label>`.
* :py:meth:`~.signal.Signal.unfolded` context manager.
* :py:meth:`~.signal.Signal.derivative` method.
* :ref:`syntax to access the components in the model <model_components-label>`
  that includes pretty printing of the components.

API changes
-----------

* :py:mod:`~.hyperspy.hspy` is now deprecated in favour of the new
  :py:mod:`~.hyperspy.api`. The new API renames and/or move several modules as
  folows:

    * ``hspy.components`` -> ``api.model.components``
    * ``hspy.utils``-> ``api``
    * ``hspy.utils.markers`` ``api.plot.markers``
    * ``hspy.utils.example_signals`` -> ``api.datasets.example_signals``


    In HyperSpy 0.8.1 the full content of :py:mod:`~.hyperspy.hspy` is still
    imported in the user namespace, but this can now be disabled in
    ``hs.preferences.General.import_hspy``. In HyperSpy 0.9 it will be
    disabled by default and the :py:mod:`~.hyperspy.hspy` module will be fully
    removed in HyperSpy 0.10. We encourage all users to migrate to the new
    syntax. For more details see :ref:`importing_hyperspy-label`.
* Indexing the :py:class:`~.signal.Signal` class is now deprecated. We encourage
  all users to use ``isig`` and ``inav`` instead for indexing.
* :py:func:`~.hyperspy.hspy.create_model` is now deprecated in favour of the new
  equivalent :py:meth:`~.signal.Signal.create_model` ``Signal`` method.
* :py:meth:`~.signal.Signal.unfold_if_multidim` is deprecated.

* The axes can now be given using their name e.g. ``s.crop("x", 1,10)``
* New syntax to specify position over axes: an integer specifies the indexes
  over the axis and a floating number specifies the position in the axis units
  e.g. ``s.crop("x", 1, 10.)`` crops over the axis `x` (in meters) from index 1
  to value 10 meters. Note that this may make your old scripts behave in
  unexpected ways as just renaming the old \*_in_units and \*_in_values methods
  won't work in most cases.
* Most methods now use the natural order i.e. X,Y,Z.. to index the axes.
* Add padding to fourier-log and fourier-ratio deconvolution to fix the
  wrap-around problem and increase its performance.
* New
  :py:meth:`~.components.eels_cl_edge.EELSCLEdge.get_fine_structure_as_spectrum`
  EELSCLEdge method.

  :py:meth:`~.model.Model.set_parameters_value`,
  :py:meth:`~.model.Model.set_parameters_free` and
  :py:meth:`~.model.Model.set_parameters_not_free`

  at once.
* New
  :py:func:`~.misc.utils.stack` function to stack signals.

  :py:meth:`~.signal.Signal.var`, and
  :py:meth:`~.signal.Signal.std`.

  ``>>> s = signals.Spectrum(np.arange(10))`` instead of
  ``>>> s = signals.Spectrum({'data' : np.arange(10)})``
